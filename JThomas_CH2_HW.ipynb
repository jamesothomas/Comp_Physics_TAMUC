    "\n",
    "In condensed matter physics the Madelung constant gives the total electric potential felt by an atom in a solid. it depends on the charges on the other atoms nearby and their locations. Consider for instance solid sodium chloride -- table salt. The sodium chloride crystal has atoms arranced on a cubic lattice, bu the alternating sodium and chlorine atoms, the dodium ones having a single positive charge $+e$ and the chlorine ones a single negative charge $-e$, where $e$ is the charge on the electron. If we label each position on the lattice by three integer coordinates $(i,j,k)$, thn the sodium atoms fall at positions where $i+j+k$ is even, and the chlorin atoms at positions where $i+j+k$ is odd.\n",
    "\n",
    "Condsider a sodium atom at the origin, $i=j=k=0$, and let us calculate the Madelung constant. if the spacing of atoms on the lattice is $a$, then the distance from the origin to the atom at position $(i,j,k)$ is \n",

    "with $\\epsilon _0$ being the permittivity of the vacuum and the sign of the expression depending on whether $i+j+k$ is even or odd. The total potential felt by the sodium atom is then the sum of this quantity over all other atoms. Let us assume a cubic box around the sodium at the origin. with $L$ atoms in all directions. Then\n",

    "\n",
    "The program in Example 2.8 is not a very efficient way of calculating prime numbers: it checks each number to see if it is divisible by an number less than it. we can develop a much faster program for prime numbers by making use of the following observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) A number $n$ is prime if it has no prime factors less than $n$. Hence we only need to check if it is divisible by other primes.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) If a number $n$ is non-prime, having a factor $r$, then $n = rs$, where $s$ is also a factor. If $r \\ge \\sqrt{n} $ then $n = rs \\ge \\sqrt{n}s$, which implies that $s \\le \\sqrt{n}$. In other words, any non-prime must have factors, and hence also prime factors, less than or equal to $\\sqrt{n}$. Thus to determine if a number is prime we have to check its prime factors only up to and including $\\sqrt{n}$ -- if there are none then the number is prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) If we find even a single prime factor less than $\\sqrt{n} $ then we know that the number is non-prime, and hence there is no need to check any further -- we can abandon this number and move on to something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a Python program that finds all the primes up to ten thousand. Create a list to store the primes, which starts out with just one prime number 2 in it. Then for each number $n$ from 3 to 10000 check whether the number is divisible by any of the primes in the list up to and including $\\sqrt{n}$. As soon as you find a single prime factor you can stop checking the rest of them -- you know $n$ is not a prime. If you find no prime factors $\\sqrt{n}$ or less then $n$ is prime and you should add it to the list. You can print out the list all in one go at the end of the program, or you can print out the individual number as you find them."
